# ZYNC
A local ZIP synncing software using TCP connections.

## Introduction to ZYNC


### Background and Problem of ZYNC
The studio I interned for, Antiloop, is a virtual reality (VR) experience company. While I interned there, I noticed that other developers often spend up to 20 - 30 mintues to implement each build. So I want to reduce the time thus improve the studio's efficiency.

### What is ZYNC
detects changes in the target directories and transfer them through TCP connections.

I wrote a wrapper for the socket module and deesigned my graphical user interface (GUI) around the wrapper.
I have examples in the src/examples folder. You can see how the connection backbone works in command prompt.

There are two main parts to this project: client side and server side. (duh)

Let's start with client side since it is easier:

Then here is the server side in details:
